# Changes I need to make to the webstie

## CV Page:
<!-- - Make logo in work experience a two column affair -->
- Make dropwdown menu with descriptions for education, publications, and open source contribs
- Play with the fonts to make it look nicer overall
- Add AI-generated stock photos to make it look visually appealing

## General:
- Add banner to the top of the page. Should look interesting, and fit the color theme.
- Make analytics work
- Make links look better somehow
- Use different font for headers
