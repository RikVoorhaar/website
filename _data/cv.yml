  - "Generally I'm interested in tensors and numerical linear algebra with a focus on applications to machine learning. Currently I'm working on developing a streaming sketch algorithm for tensor trains. This will make it feasible to compute
  tensor train decompositions of very large tensors in a distributed setting. "
  - "On the weekends I like to study topics in data science, bioinformatics and scientific computing to broaden my knowledge. I do this by either taking online courses, reading text books, or doing small programming projects. For the latter I usually write blog posts on this website."

  - name: "TTML: tensor trains for general supervised machine learning"
    date: March 2022
    url: https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04352
    description: We describe how to use tensor trains to parametrize discretized functions, and how to get a useful supervised machine learning estimator out of it. Learning and initializing these tensor trains is a bit tricky, but definitely doable. I also wrote <a href="/discrete-function-tensor/">a blog post</a> about this paper, explaining the main ideas in a more accessible way.

  - name: On certain Hochschild cohomology groups for the small quantum group
    date: April 2021
    publisher: Journal of Algebra
    url: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalgebra.2022.04.034
    description: We apply the algorithm for the BGG resolution developed in the previous paper to compute Hochschild cohomology of blocks of the small quantum group. This allows us to study the center of the small quantum group, and our computations give stronger evidence for several conjectures concerning the small quantum group. My contribution was writing all the code needed for this project.

  - name: A computer algorithm for the BGG resolution
    date: November 2019
    url: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalgebra.2020.09.043
    description: In this work we describe an algorithm to compute the BGG resolution for modules over a simple Lie algebra. This is then used to compute various thing like the Hochschild cohomology of some flag varieties. My contribution was coding the implementation of the algorithm, and solving several algorithmic problems.

  - name: Parallel 2-transport and 2-group torsors
    date: October 2018
    url: https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10060
    description:  This work is a continuation of my masters thesis. The idea is to study a toy model of principal 2-bundles and 2-transport by restricting to a stricter notion, where the fibers are all strict 2-groups. This allows to get some nice generalizations of the classical theory, which would be harder to proof in the more general setting.

  - name: ttml python package
    url: https://github.com/RikVoorhaar/ttml
    description: A novel machine learning estimator based on Tensor Trains. I wrote this library by myself, and includes many features for optimizing tensor trains in addition to the machine learning capabilities.
  - name: bgg-cohomology sage package
    url: https://github.com/RikVoorhaar/bgg-cohomology
    description: I wrote a Sagemath package used for computing the BGG resolution of simple Lie algebra modules and the associated cohomology.
  - name: geoopt
    url: https://github.com/geoopt/geoopt
    description: This is a package for Riemannian optimization using PyTorch. I added a Riemannian line search and conjugate gradient optimizer to this project. 
  - name: autoray
    url: https://github.com/jcmgray/autoray
    description: This is a package meant to help writing backend agnostic code, i.e. code that can manipulate objects from different numerical libraries like numpy, tensorflow or pytorch (among others). I added a few extra translations from the numpy API to other libraries, I improved the functionality to infer the backend of the arguments of some functions, and I made data type handling for array creation operations more consistent.


work:
  - name: PhD student
    date: March 2018--December 2022 (expected)
    location: University of Geneva
    description: I was working in pure mathematics from 2018 until early 2020, when I switched research direction to applied math. Over the past few years a significant fraction of my time is spent writing research code in Python, both numerical code and code for computer algebra. I spend about 20% of my time teaching. I also spend about 20% of my time studying to broaden my knowledge about data science and scientific computing, either by doing online courses, reading text books, or doing small programming projects.

    description: The goal of this journal is to make the core ideas behind published scientific research accessible to a wide audience to foster interest in science. It is also an excellent and informal way for scientists to get a flavor of the research and scientific methods of very different fields. As an editor I propose new articles and edit them to make them easier to read for laypersons.
