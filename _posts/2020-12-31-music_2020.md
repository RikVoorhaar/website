It goes without saying that 2020 is a special year in a number of ways. I want to look back at what
2020 meant for me in terms of music. As a side effect of staying home almost all year, I have also
listened to more music than previous years. In fact, I listened to music roughly twice as much in
2020 compared to 2019, although it still can't match my high school levels. Below is a bar plot of
my number of last.fm scrobbles since 2010.

On a less positive note, 2020 is also the year Google Play Music stopped. I'm very sad about this,
as it had both great streaming features and allowed you to listen to your own uploaded music
seamlessly. YouTube music is not a good replacement, so I switched to Spotify. This still leaves a
lot to be desired, since I can't add my own music to the Spotify library and listening to any music
that's not in the Spotify library is a hassle. On the plus side, Spotify does have a larger
collection of music than Google Play Music did.

In the rest of this post I want to look back on the music I discovered during 2020. There has been a
lot of great music that came out this year, but also a lot of music that was released before 2020
that I only discovered this year. This is not a complete list, but rather a list of the albums that
had the most impact on me in no particular order. This list was compiled by looking at all the
albums I listened much more than in all other years combined. I have listened to some of these
albums before 2020, but I didn't really get into them before. Let us start with the albums that were
actually released this year. 

## Music from 2020

### Fiona Apple - Fetch the Bolt Cutters (2020)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" src="/imgs/music_2020/fetch_the_boltcutters.jpg" width="150"/>
_Genre: Art Pop_  
This is definitely the album of the year for me. I can't quite put my finger on why, but this album
just sounds amazing. I think it's the overall sound of the album that really draws me in, and it
doesn't become boring even after dozens of listens.

### Gezan - KLUE (2020)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" src="/imgs/music_2020/klue.jpg" width="150"/>

_Genre: Noise Rock_  
Definitely one of the weirder albums of this year. At times intense, at times hypnotic and at other
times very calm. The album transitions between different moods very smoothly and results a coherent
interesting piece of music.

<div style="clear: left;"></div>

### King Krule - Man Alive! (2020)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" src="/imgs/music_2020/man_alive.jpg" width="150"/>

_Genre: Post-Punk_  
Calm, melancholic and noisy. The texture and sound of this album is great, and just gets better
every time you listen to it.

<div style="clear: left;"></div>

### Jeff Rosenstock - NO DREAM (2020)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" src="/imgs/music_2020/no_dream.jpg" width="150"/>
_Genre: Pop Punk_  
Very energetic, although the latter half of the album is very melancholic. The lyrics are also very
witty, and the noisy guitar riffs are nice, but in the end I think I like it because it's just a
really catchy record. 

<div style="clear: left;"></div>

### Klô Pelgag - Notre-Dame-des-Sept-Douleurs (2020)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;"
src="/imgs/music_2020/notre-dame-des-sept-douleurs.jpg" width="150"/>
_Genre: Art/Baroque Pop_   
Probably the first French-language pop I have to come to enjoy, and probably the second best album
that came out this year as far as I'm concerned. The instrumentals on this record are perfect, and
the melody is incredibly catchy. 

<div style="clear: left;"></div>

### Pottery - Welcome to Bobby's Motel (2020)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" src="/imgs/music_2020/welcome_to_bobbys_motel.jpg"
width="150"/>
_Genre: Dance Punk_   
This record sounds a lot like Talking Heads' _Remain in the Light_, and this is not a bad thing. 

<div style="clear: left;"></div>

### The Microphones - Microphones in 2020 (2020)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" src="/imgs/music_2020/microphones_in_2020.jpg"
width="150"/>
_Genre: Indie Folk_   
The "music video" of this album is a 45 minute video showing photographs, and I was glued to my
screen every second of it. The sound is repetitive, and it draws you in; hypnotizes you. On top of
that, it is almost as packed with emotion as _A Crow Looked At Me_. 


<div style="clear: left;"></div>

## Other music I discovered in 2020

### Tom Waits - Rain Dogs (1985)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" src="/imgs/music_2020/rain_dogs.jpg" width="150"/>
_Genre: Singer/Songwriter, Experimental Rock_  
I'm surprised I only discovered Tom Waits this year. Waits' deep smoky voice and bluesy songs are
wonderful. It's hard to pin this record down to a single genre, yet the sound is completely
coherent. 

<div style="clear: left;"></div>

### Duster - Duster (2019)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" src="/imgs/music_2020/duster.jpg" width="150"/>
_Genre: Slowcore_  
Slow, noisy and hypnotic. This album will calmly you put you into a trance, but never leave you
bored.

<div style="clear: left;"></div>

### Hella - Hold Your Horse Is (2002)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" src="/imgs/music_2020/hold_your_horse_is.jpg"
width="150"/>
_Genre: Math Rock_  
Very complex and technical instrumental math rock. Often I lose interest in purely instrumental albums
after a couple listens, but this album definitely stays interesting even after many listens.


<div style="clear: left;"></div>

### Milton Nascimento & Lô Borges - Clube da Esquina (1972)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" src="/imgs/music_2020/clube_da_esquina.jpg" width="150"/>
_Genre: Música Popular Brasileira_  
This is my first exposure to Brazillian music. After discovering this album I tried a number of
other albums in the same genre, but nothing comes close to this. 

<div style="clear: left;"></div>



### Have a Nice Life - Deathconsciousness (2008)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" src="/imgs/music_2020/deathconsciousness.jpg"
width="150"/>
_Genre: Post-Punk_  
I have been aware of this album for a long time, since I used to browse /mu/ in high school, but I
only really got into it this year. The album is very intense, and I simply love the lo-fi sound of
the record.

<div style="clear: left;"></div>

### Shellac - At Action Park (1994)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" src="/imgs/music_2020/at_action_park.jpg"
width="150"/>
_Genre: Post-Hardcore, Math Rock_  
Beautiful, noisy sound. Reminds me a lot of Number Girl, but with a much stronger beat. It's hard
not to bop my head to this. 

<div style="clear: left;"></div>

### IDLES - Joy as an Act of Resistance. (2018)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;"
src="/imgs/music_2020/joy_as_an_act_of_resistance.jpg" width="150"/>
_Genre: Post-Punk_  
Incredibly energetic punk. It takes a very wholesome spin on the traditional anarchistic lyrics of
punk rock. IDLES also released an album in 2020, and while it's certainly good, it didn't leave
nearly as much as an impression on me as this album.

<div style="clear: left;"></div>

### Purple Mountains - Purple Mountains (2019)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" src="/imgs/music_2020/purple_mountains.jpg" width="150"/>
_Genre: Alt-Country_  
Country rock meets existential dread. 

<div style="clear: left;"></div>

### Acid Bath - When the Kite String Pops (1994)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" src="/imgs/music_2020/when_the_kite_string_pops.jpg"
width="150"/>
_Genre: Sludge Metal_  
Like Melvins' or Boris' Sludge Metal records, but much more raw and dark. I love it.

<div style="clear: left;"></div>

### Black Flag - My War (1984)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" src="/imgs/music_2020/my_war.jpg" width="150"/>
_Genre: Hardcore Punk_  
The lyrics are a bit angsty, but the dark, raw, noisy sound more than makes up for that. 


<div style="clear: left;"></div>

### clipping. - There Existed an Addiction to Blood (2019)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;"
src="/imgs/music_2020/there_existed_an_addiction_to_blood.jpg" width="150"/> 
_Genre: Industrial Hip-Hop, Horrorcore_  
This is probably the biggest surprise for me this year. I didn't expect to like
this at all, but I really do. For some reason I find it difficult to like hip-hop, especially rap.
Perhaps the noisy sound of this album is what attracts me to it. 

<div style="clear: left;"></div>

### Built to Spill - Perfect From Now On (1997)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" src="/imgs/music_2020/perfect_from_now_on.jpg"
width="150"/>
_Genre: Indie Rock_  
A lo-fi indie pop, but still definitely sounds like the 90s, and definitely holds up against some of
the best albums of that decade.

<div style="clear: left;"></div>



### Current 93 - Thunder Perfect Mind (1992)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" src="/imgs/music_2020/thunder_perfect_mind.jpeg"
width="150"/>
_Genre: Neofolk_  
A sombre, melancholic, acoustic album. At first I didn't like this album, but a few months after
listening to this album for a few times several songs got stuck into my head. I then listened to the
album again and found that I suddenly really enjoyed it. 

<div style="clear: left;"></div>

### Comus - First Utterance (1971)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" src="/imgs/music_2020/first_utterance.jpg"
width="150"/>
_Genre: Progressive Folk, Freak Folk_  
Grim, psychedelic and intense. The album draws you in, despite its dark and disturbing content.


<div style="clear: left;"></div>

### 공중도둑 (Mid-Air Thief) - 공중도덕 (Gongjoong Doduk) (2015)

<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" src="/imgs/music_2020/gongjoong_doduk.jpg"
width="150"/>
_Genre: Psychedelic Folk_  
Psychedelic, yet calm and relaxing. Probably my first exposure to Korean music (other than k-pop),
and I definitely want to hear more of this.
