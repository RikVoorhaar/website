  - name: "Tensor Train Approximations: Riemannian Methods, Randomized Linear Algebra and Applications to Machine Learning"
    date: December 2022 (PhD Thesis)
    url: https://doi.org/10.13097/archive-ouverte/unige:166308
    description: This is my PhD thesis, which is mostly an extended version of my two papers together with Bart Vandereycken, together with a comphrensive preliminaries section.

  - name: "Streaming Tensor Train Approximation"
    date: August 2022
    url: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2208.02600
    description: Inspired by the generalized Nyström approximation for low-rank matrices, we created a randomized streaming algorithm for computing tensor trains. This algorithm can quickly compute accurate approximations of a wide variety of tensors (multi-dimensional arrays). It does this by 'sketching' the tensor by multiplying with random tensors to quickly find a small subspace in which it is easy to approximate the tensor. This is a streaming algorithm, which means that we only need to do a single pass over the data of the tensor we want to approximate. It also means it works really well in a distributed setting, and scales very well to big data.

  - name: "TTML: tensor trains for general supervised machine learning"
    date: March 2022
    url: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2203.04352
    description: We describe how to use tensor trains to parametrize discretized functions, and how to get a useful supervised machine learning estimator out of it. Learning and initializing these tensor trains is a bit tricky, but definitely doable. I also wrote <a href="/discrete-function-tensor/">a blog post</a> about this paper, explaining the main ideas in a more accessible way.

  - name: On certain Hochschild cohomology groups for the small quantum group
    date: April 2021
    publisher: Journal of Algebra
    url: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalgebra.2022.04.034
    description: We apply the algorithm for the BGG resolution developed in the previous paper to compute Hochschild cohomology of blocks of the small quantum group. This allows us to study the center of the small quantum group, and our computations give stronger evidence for several conjectures concerning the small quantum group. My contribution was writing all the code needed for this project.

  - name: A computer algorithm for the BGG resolution
    date: November 2019
    url: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalgebra.2020.09.043
    description: In this work we describe an algorithm to compute the BGG resolution for modules over a simple Lie algebra. This is then used to compute various thing like the Hochschild cohomology of some flag varieties. My contribution was coding the implementation of the algorithm, and solving several algorithmic problems.

  - name: Parallel 2-transport and 2-group torsors
    date: October 2018
    url: https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10060
    description:  This work is a continuation of my masters thesis. The idea is to study a toy model of principal 2-bundles and 2-transport by restricting to a stricter notion, where the fibers are all strict 2-groups. This allows to get some nice generalizations of the classical theory, which would be harder to proof in the more general setting.

I added a few extra translations from the numpy API to other libraries, I improved the functionality to infer the backend of the arguments of some functions, and I made data type handling for array creation operations more consistent.
