A few weeks ago I had the pleasure of defending my thesis and finally obtaining the elusive title of doctor.
This blog post is essentially the contents of my thesis defense in written form, and it should for the most be
very accessible. This is subdivided into several parts, roughly becoming more technical as we go along.

## Low-rank matrices

My thesis deals specifically with low-rank tensors, but before we dive into low-rank tensors it makes sense to first talk about low-rank matrices. This is something we also discussed in [this blog post](/low-rank-matrix). A low-rank matrix is nothing more than the product of two smaller matrices. For example below we write the matrix $$A$$ as the product $$A=XY^\top$$.

In this case the matrix $$X$$ is of size $$m\times r$$ and the matrix $$Y$$ is $$n\times r$$. This usually means that the product $$A$$ is a rank-$$r$$ matrix, you can only conclude that the rank of $$A$$ is _at most_ $$r$$. For example, one of the rows of $$X$$ or $$Y$$ may be equal to zero.

Some matrices encountered 'in the wild' are of low rank, but usually, they are not. However, many matrices can be very well approximated by low-rank matrices. A nice example of this is images, which (if we consider each color channel separately) are just matrices.
