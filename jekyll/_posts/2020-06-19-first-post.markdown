Ah, the classical "first post", often the only post in the blog. Let us hope this is not the case.

I feel like I should write down some things about my side projects. I tried using Medium, but it has
two significant problems: the platform feels too monetized, and it really doesn't work very well
together with LaTeX. Since I like to think a lot in mathematical terms, having good LaTeX support
is just essential.

This website is made using Jekyll and hosted on github-pages. I don't know how good this is, but we
shall see. At least like it better.

I hope to shortly make a couple posts about recent projects:

* Bayesian analysis of exam grades (I posted this over on Github, but since then I have done significant work on the subject)
* Analysis of moodle-logs
* Analysis of my last.fm scrobble history
* Analysis of ISU figure skating scores, and proving statistically the fact that judging is biased.
* How to scrape data from pdf files (using the ISU scores as example)
