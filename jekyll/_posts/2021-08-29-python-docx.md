In preparation for the job market, I started polishing my CV. I try to keep the
CV on my website as up-to-date as possible, but many recruiters and companies
prefer a single-page neat CV in a Microsoft Word document. I used to always make
my CV's in LaTeX, but it seems Word is often preferred since it's easier to
edit for third parties.

Keeping both a web, Word, and PDF version all up-to-date and easy to edit seemed
like an annoying task. I have plenty experience with automatically generating 
PDF documents using LaTeX and Python, so I figured why should a Word document be
any different? Let's dive into the world of editing Word documents in Python!

Fortunately there is a library for this: `python-docx`. It can be used to create
Word documents from scratch, but stylizing a document is a bit tricky. Instead,
its real power lies in editing pre-made documents. I went ahead and made a nice
looking CV in Word, and now let's open this document in `python-docx`. A Word
document is stored in XML under the hoods, and there can be a complicated tree
structure to a document. However, we can create a document and use the
`.paragraphs` attribute for a complete list of all the paragraphs in the
document. Let's take a paragraph, and print it's text content.


```python
from docx import Document

document = Document("resume.docx")
paragraph = document.paragraphs[0]
print(paragraph.text)
```

    Rik Voorhaar


Turns out the first paragraph contains my name! Editing this text is very easy;
we just need to set a new value to the `.text` attribute. Let's do this and safe 
the document.


```python
paragraph.text = "Willem Hendrik"
document.save("resume_edited.docx")
```

Below is a picture of the resulting change; it unfortunately seems like two
additional things happened when editing this paragraph: the font of the edited
paragraph changed, and the bar / text box on the right-hand side disappeared
completely!

![img](/imgs/python_docx/doc_comparison.png)

This is no good, but to understand what happened to the text box we need to 
dig into the XML of the document. We can turn the document into an XML file like 
so:


```python
document = Document("resume.docx")
with open('resume.xml', 'w') as f:
	f.write(document._element.xml)
```

It seems the problem was that the text box on the right was nested inside an
other object, which is apparently not handled properly. This issue was easy to
fix by modifying the Word document. However, the right bar on the side consists
of 2 text boxes, and the top box with my contact information _does_ disappear if
I change the first paragraph. _But_, it does not disappear if I change the
second paragraph; it only happens if I change paragraph 1 or 3 (and the latter
is empty). I tried inserting two paragraphs before this particular paragraph, or
changing the style of this particular paragraph, but the issue remains.

Looking at the XML the issue is clear: the text box element lies nested inside
this paragraph! It turned out to be a bit tricky to avoid this, so for now let
us then try changing the second paragraph, changing the word "resume" for
"curriculum vitae". 


```python
document = Document("resume.docx")
paragraph = document.paragraphs[1]
print(paragraph.text)
paragraph.text = "Curriculum Vitae"
document.save("CV.docx")
```

    Resume


If we do this there's no problems with text boxes disappearing, but
unfortunately the style of this paragraph is still reset when we do this. Let's
have a look at how the XML changes when we edit this paragraph. Ignoring
irrelevant information, before changing it looks like this:

```xml
<w:p>
    <w:r>
    <w:t>R</w:t>
    </w:r>
    <w:r>
    <w:t>esume</w:t>
    </w:r>
</w:p>
```

And afterwards it looks like this:
```xml
<w:p>
    <w:r>
    <w:t>Curriculum Vitae</w:t>
    </w:r>
</w:p>
```

In Word, each paragraph (`<p>`) is split up in multiple runs (`<r>`). What we
see here is that originally the paragraph was two runs, and after modifying it,
it became a single run. However, it seems that in both cases the style
information is exactly the same, so I don't understand why the style changes
after modification. In this case if I retype the word 'Resume' in the original
word document, this paragraph become a single run, but _still_ the style changes
after editing, and I still don't see why this happens when looking at the XML.

Looking at the source code of `python-docx` I noticed that when we call
`paragraph.text = ...`, what happens is that the contents of the paragraph get
deleted, and then a new run is added with the desired text. It is not clear to
me at where exactly the style information is stored, but either way there is a 
simple workaround to what we're trying to do: we can simply modify the text of
the first _run_ in the paragraph, rather than clearing the entire paragraph and
adding a new one. This in fact also works for editing the first paragraph,
where before we had problems with disappearing text boxes:


```python
document = Document("resume.docx")
with open('resume.xml', 'w') as f:
	f.write(document._element.xml)

# Change 'Rik Voorhaar' for 'Willem Hendrik Voorhaar'
paragraph = document.paragraphs[0]
run = paragraph.runs[1]
run.text = 'Willem Hendrik Voorhaar'

# Change 'Resume' for 'Curriculum Vitae'
paragraph = document.paragraphs[1]
run = paragraph.runs[0]
run.text = 'Curriculum Vitae'
document.save('CV.docx')
```

Doing this changes the text, but leaves all the style information the
same. Alright, now we now how to edit text. It's more tricky than one might
expect, but it does work! 

## Dealing with text boxes

Let's say that next we want to edit the text box on the right-hand side of the 
document, and add a skill to our list of skills. We've been diving into the 
inner workings of Word documents, so it's fair to say we know how to use 
Microsoft Word, so let's add the skill "Microsoft Word" to the list.

To do this we first want to figure out in which paragraph this information is
stored. We can do this by going through all the paragraphs in the document and
looking for the text "Skills".


```python
import re
pattern = re.compile("Skills")
for p in document.paragraphs:
    if pattern.search(p.text):
        print("Found the paragraph!")
        break
else:
    print("Did not find the paragraph :(")
```

    Did not find the paragraph :(


Seems like there is unfortunately no matching paragraph! This is because the 
paragraph we want is _inside a text box_, and modifying text boxes is not supported
in `python-docx`. This is a known issue, but instead of giving up I decided to
add support for modifying text boxes to `python-docx` myself! It turned out not to
be too difficult to implement, despite my limited knowledge of both the package
and the inner structure of Word documents.

The first step is understanding how text boxes are encoded in the XML. It turns
out that the structure is something like this:

```XML
<mc:AlternateContent>
    <mc:Choice Requires="wps">
        <w:drawing>
            <wp:anchor>
                <a:graphics>
                    <a:graphicData>
                        <wps:txbx>
                            <w:txbxContent>
                            ...
                            <w:txbxContent>
                        </wps:txbx>
                    </a:graphicData>                 
                </a:graphics>
            </wp:anchor>
        </w:drawing>
    </mc:Choice>
    <mc:Fallback>
        <w:pict>
            <v:textbox>
                <w:txbxContent>
                ...
                <w:txbxContent>
            </v:textbox>
        </w:pict>
    </mc:Fallback>
</mc:AlternateContent>
```

The insides of the two `<w:txbxContent>` elements are exactly identical. The
information is stored twice probably for legacy reasons. A quick Google reveals
that `wps` is an XML namespace introduced in Office 2010, and WPS is short for
Word Processing Shape. The textbox is therefore stored twice to maintain
backwards compatibility with older Word versions. Not sure many people still use
Office 2006... Either way, this means that if we want to update the contents of
the textbox, we need to do it in two places. 

Next we need to figure out how to manipulate these word objects. My idea is to
create a `TextBox` class, that is associated to an `<mc:AlternateContent>`
element, and which ensures that both `<w:txbxContent>` elements are always
updated at the same time. First we make a class encoding a `<w:txbxContent>`
element. For this we can build on the `BlockItemContainer` class already
implemented in `python-docx`. Mixing in this class gives automatic support for
manipulating paragraphs inside of the container. 
```py
class TextBoxContent(BlockItemContainer)
```

Given an `<mc:AlternateContent>` object, we can access the two `<w:txbxContent>`
elements using the following XPath specifications:

```py
XPATH_CHOICE = "./mc:Choice/w:drawing/wp:anchor/a:graphic/a:graphicData//wps:txbx/w:txbxContent"
XPATH_FALLBACK = "./mc:Fallback/w:pict//v:textbox/w:txbxContent"
```

Then making a rudimentary `TextBox` class is very simple. We base it on the
`ElementProxy` class in `python-docx`. This class is meant for storing and
manipulating the children of an XML element.

```py
class TextBox(ElementProxy):
        """Implements texboxes. Requires an `<mc:AlternateContent>` element."""

    def __init__(self, element, parent):
        super(TextBox, self).__init__(element, parent)

        try:
            (tbox1,) = element.xpath(XPATH_CHOICE)
            (tbox2,) = element.xpath(XPATH_FALLBACK)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "This element is not a text box; it should contain precisely two \
                    ``<w:txbxContent>`` objects"
            )
        self.tbox1 = TextBoxContent(tbox1, self)
        self.tbox2 = TextBoxContent(tbox2, self)
```

So far this is just good for storing the text box, we still need some code to
actually manipulate it. It would also be great if we have a way to find all the
text boxes in a document. This is as simple as finding all the
`<mc:AlternateContent>` elements with precisely two `<w:txbxContent>` elements. 
We can use the following function:

```py
def find_textboxes(element, parent):
    """
    List all text box objects in the document.

    Looks for all ``<mc:AlternateContent>`` elements, and selects those
    which contain a text box. 
    """
    alt_cont_elems = element.xpath(".//mc:AlternateContent")
    text_boxes = []
    for elem in alt_cont_elems:
        tbox1 = elem.xpath(XPATH_CHOICE)
        tbox2 = elem.xpath(XPATH_FALLBACK)
        if len(tbox1) == 1 and len(tbox2) == 1:
            text_boxes.append(TextBox(elem, parent))
    return text_boxes
```

We then update the `Document` class with a new `textboxes` attribute:

```py
@property
def textboxes(self):
    """
    List all text box objects in the document.
    """
    return find_textboxes(self._element, self)
```

Now let's test this out:


```python
document = Document("resume.docx")
document.textboxes
```




    [<docx.oxml.textbox.TextBox at 0x7faf395c3bc0>,
     <docx.oxml.textbox.TextBox at 0x7faf395c3100>]



Now to manipulate the "Skills" section as we initially wanted, we first find the
right paragraph. Since the two `<w:txbxContent>` objects have the same
paragraphs, we need to find which _number_ of paragraph contains the text, and
in which textbox:


```python
import re
def find_paragraph(pattern):
    for textbox in document.textboxes:  
        for i,p in enumerate(textbox.paragraphs):
            if pattern.search(p.text):
                return textbox,i
pattern = re.compile("Skills")
textbox, i = find_paragraph(pattern)
print(textbox.paragraphs[i].text)
```

    Skills


Now to insert a new skill, we need to create a new paragraph with the text
"Microsoft Word". For this we can find the paragraph right after, and this
paragraphs `insert_paragraph_before` method with appropriate text and style
information. The paragraph in question is the one containing the word
"Research". I want to copy the style of this paragraph to the new paragraph, but
for some reason the style information is empty for this paragraph. However, I
know that the style of this paragraph should be the `'Skillsentries'`, so I can
just use that directly.


```python
style = document.styles['Skillsentries']

pattern = re.compile("Research")
textbox,i = find_paragraph(pattern)

p1 = textbox.tbox1.paragraphs[i]
p2 = textbox.tbox2.paragraphs[i]

for p in (p1,p2):
    p.insert_paragraph_before("Microsoft Word", p.style)
document.save("CV.docx")
```

When now opening the Word document, we see the item "Microsoft Word" in my list
of skills, with the right style and everything. I did cheat a little; I needed
to make some additional technical changes to the code for this all to work, but
the details are not super important. If you want to use this feature, you can
use [my fork of python-docx](https://github.com/RikVoorhaar/python-docx). My 
solution is still a little hacky, so I don't think it will be added to the main 
repository, but it does work fine for my purposes.


## Conclusion

In summary, we _can_ use Python to edit word documents. However the
`python-docx` package is not fully mature, and using it for editing
highly-stylized word documents is a bit painful (but possible!). It is however
quite easy to extend with new functionality, in case you do need to do this. On
the other hand, there is quite extensive functionality in Visual Basic to edit
word documents, and the whole Word API is built around Visual Basic. 

While I now have all the tools available to automatically update my CV using
Python, I will actually refrain from doing it. It is a lot of work to set up
properly, and needs active maintenance ever time I would want to change the
styling of my CV. Probably it's a better idea to just manually edit it every
time I need to. Automatization isn't always worth it. But I wouldn't be
surprised if this new found skill will be useful at some point in the future for
me.
