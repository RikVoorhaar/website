# Hello

I am a recent PhD graduate from the University of Geneva, where I did research in tensor networks, numerical linear algebra and machine learning. I like to do data science and numerical mathematics as a hobby, and I use this
website as a blog and document some of my projects.

Feel free to contact me if you're interested in any of the things I do!
