# Hello

I am a math PhD student at the University of Geneva, doing research in tensor networks, numerical
linear algebra and machine learning. I like to do data science as a hobby, and I will use this
website as a blog and post some of my projects.

Feel free to contact me if you're interested in any of the things I do!
