Besides being a math student, it turns out I'm actually a person!

## Interests

### Music

Music is a big part of my life! I like almost any kind of rock music, but I tend to gravitate
towards heavier and noisier genres. Check out my [last.fm page](https://www.last.fm/user/Tilpo)
and my [rym page](https://rateyourmusic.com/~Tilpo)!

I like to play electric guitar. I have Japanese made Fender "Aerodyne" strat, and an Epiphone
Les Paul model (tuned to drop Bâ™­!). I also have more pairs of headphones than I can count...

### Gaming

I really enjoy playing open world (both RPG and survivalcraft) games, the
feeling of freedom, exploration  and creativity is wonderful. I also really
enjoy replaying old (Nintendo) games from my youth. Sandbox games and grand
strategy games are also amazing. I'm very enthusiastic about speedrunning and
its wonderful community. It feels like taking the scientific approach to gaming.

### Cooking

I love cooking and the sense of satisfaction that comes with eating food you made yourself.
I don't shy away from any cuisine, and I'm constantly trying to improve and learn new things.

### Reading

I like to read hard sci-fi books, some of my favorite series are The Expanse
(Corey), Foundation (Asimov), The Bobiverse (Taylor) and Old Man's War (Scalzi).
I'm also a big fan of the books of Murakami. Recently I've been on  a spree of
reading long fantasy series. I have read the Lord of the Rings, Stormlight
Archive, and Song of Ice and Fire. At the moment I'm working my way through the
Mistborn series. Check out [my goodreads page](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62542056-tilpo) for more!

### Engineering

I am fascinated with engineering of many kinds. For example I am fascinated by logistics, civil
engineering, rocket science, semiconductors, and computing. Rather than academic research in these
areas I tend to watch YouTube channels and read wikipedia articles. There is so much fascinating
thought behind everything we experience around us. Here are some of my favorite YouTube channels:
