Besides being a math student, it turns out I'm actually a person!

## Interests

### Music

Music is a big part of my life! I like almost any kind of rock music, but I tend to gravitate
towards heavier and noisier genres. Check out my [last.fm page](https://www.last.fm/user/Tilpo)
and my [rym page](https://rateyourmusic.com/~Tilpo)!

I like to play electric guitar. I have Japanese made Fender "Aerodyne" strat, and an Epiphone
Les Paul model (tuned to drop B♭!). I also have more pairs of headphones than I can count...

### Gaming

I really enjoy playing open world (both RPG and survivalcraft) games, the feeling of freedom,
exploration  and creativity is wonderful. I also really enjoy replaying old (Nintendo) games from
my youth. I'm very enthusiastic about speedrunning and its wonderful community. It feels
like taking the scientific approach to gaming.

### Cooking

I love cooking and the sense of satisfaction that comes with eating food you made yourself.
I don't shy away from any cuisine, and I'm constantly trying to improve and learn new things.

### Reading

I like to read hard sci-fi books, some of my favorite series are The Expanse
(Corey), Foundation (Asimov), The Bobiverse (Taylor) and Old Man's War (Scalzi).
I'm also a big fan of the books of Murakami. I also like to read fantasy books,
and I recently came around to reading the Lord of the Rings, and the long
Stormlight Archive series by Sanderson. Currently I'm working my way through the
Song of Ice and Fire series by Martin. Check out [my goodreads
page](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62542056-tilpo) for more!

### Engineering

I am fascinated with engineering of many kinds. For example I am fascinated by logistics, civil
engineering, rocket science, semiconductors, and computing. Rather than academic research in these
areas I tend to watch YouTube channels and read wikipedia articles. There is so much fascinating
thought behind everything we experience around us. Here are some of my favorite YouTube channels:
- [New Mind](https://www.youtube.com/c/NewMind) Great production quality videos about both the
  history and the cutting edge of important technology.
- [Scott Manley](https://www.youtube.com/c/szyzyg) Frequent videos about recent space-related events
  as well as fascinating stories about the science and history of space exploration. 
- [TechTechPotato](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechTechPotato) Frequent videos about news in the 
  semiconductor industry. Dr. Ian Cutress is extremely knowledgeable about the semiconductor
  industry, and his videos are very insightful.
- [Practical Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/c/PracticalEngineeringChannel) Interesting videos
  doing deep dives into modern civil engineering, with great explanation about the concepts behind
  them.
- [Applied Science](https://www.youtube.com/c/AppliedScience) Channel documenting and explaining
  hi-tech science projects, such as building a DIY electron microscope or mass spectrometer. He
  shows that the ideas behind modern applied science are often simpler and easier to implement than
  you might think.
- [Retro Game Mechanics Explained](https://www.youtube.com/c/RetroGameMechanicsExplained) This
  channel makes videos explaining the hardware and software behind old video game consoles. For
  example he has fantastic videos about how the sprite system of the original Pokémon Red/Blue
  works, and explains in detail how this could lead to the famous MissingNo. glitch. This gives a
  lot of insight on how computers and code work at a low level.
